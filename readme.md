# Comfy Thumbs

## Comfy Thumbs is an Ergonomic keyboard that is:

- Split
- TKL (90 keys total OR 76 keys after if you remove the break-away Function-key row)
- Wifi-compatible (charges each half independently with USB-C)
- Ortholinear (Grid-style arrangement for the alpha keys)
- Coming soon: RGB
<br/>
 
### Comfortable and efficient thumb use
Inspired by:
- Keycap compatibility
- Break-away function row: either 90 keys, or 76 without

### Use your thumbs without hurting them

|Thumb Cluster Style|# of keys|Avg. reach from Home Position|
|---|---|---|
|ComfyThumbs|5|1u
|Manuform/Dactyl-Manuform|6|3.5u
|Maltron/Dacyl/Kenesis/Ergodox|6-8|4.5u

Unlike other large thumb cluster designs that waste valuable space by pushing the cluster away from resting thumb position or building the cluster on a convex plane, all thumb keys are within 1u radius of resting position. The thumbs naturally rest on either Space or Backspace, with Shift, `Ctrl`, `Alt` and `OS` nearby. There are two thumb rows; `Space`, `Backspace`, and both `Shift` are connected to main PCB of each half, but the thumb and arrow clusters are connected as breakaway clusters, which will have a profile roughly 2mm lower that theh Main PCB. 


### Comfy Thumbs = Comfy Pinkies
Your pinkies have been doing way more work than they should. That's why modifiers have moved to the thumb cluster. Adding to that, the Index fingers have a new inner column for `Tab`, `\ `, `-`, `=`,  `[` and `]`.

### Still want layers?
The bottom left and right Fn keys can be used to access QMK keyboard layers. The NumLock key can be used to turn on a tenkey layer. In the end, this is QMK - just explore and decide what you like!

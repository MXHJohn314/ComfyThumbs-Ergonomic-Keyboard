### 97.98% Keycap Compatibility

This is the most keycap-compatible, split, ortholinear, tenkey-less keyboard. Space and Backspace are the only keys that are not traditionally-sized. That means you won't need to buy/use different keycaps for `Right Shift`, `Left Shift`, `Enter`, `Tab`, `\ `, Command, `Ctrl`, `Alt`, `OS`, and `Application` keys.

### Use your thumbs without hurting them

|Thumb Cluster Style|# of keys|Avg. reach from Home Position|
|---|---|---|
|ComfyThumbs|5|1u
|Manuform/Dactyl-Manuform|6|3.5u
|Maltron/Dacyl/Kenesis/Ergodox|6-8|4.5u

Unlike other large thumb cluster designs that waste valuable space by pushing the cluster away from resting thumb position or building the cluster on a convex plane, all thumb keys are within 1u radius of resting position. The thumbs naturally rest on either Space or Backspace, with Shift, `Ctrl`, `Alt` and `OS` nearby. There are two thumb rows; `Space`, `Backspace`, and both `Shifts` have a higher profile on the upper thumb row, with the help of stem raisers to distinguish thumb location by feel. Using SA keycaps for these 4 keys is another option to get the profile difference, but we like keycap compatibility :)


### Comfy Thumbs = Comfy Pinkies
Your pinkies have been doing way more wok than they should. That's why modifiers have moved to the thumb cluster. Adding to that, the Index fingers have a new inner column for `Tab`, `\ `, `-`, `=`,  `[` and `]`.

### Still want layers?
The bottom left and right Fn keys can be used to access QMK keyboard layers. The NumLock key can be used to turn on a tenkey layer. In the end, this is QMK - just explore and decide what you like!
